# We are going to create the CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and CodePipeline objects
# This will NOT add code to CodeCommit, that must be done separately
# You will need the name of the state_bucket created in 5-remote-state-setup

# Rename terraform.tfvars.example to terraform.tfvars and update values

# Initialize the terraform configuration
terraform init

# Plan the terraform deployment
terraform plan -out code.tfplan

# Apply the deployment
terraform apply "code.tfplan"

# Make note of the code commit url
# Get Git credentials from the Console
# Clone the git repo locally and copy files in 7-code-commit-files to the repo

git clone CODE_COMMIT_URL
cp PATH_TO_YOUR_EXERCISE_FILES\7-code-commit-files\* . # <-- Adjust to the path of your exercise files

# Create a branch called main and publish the branch to CodeCommit
